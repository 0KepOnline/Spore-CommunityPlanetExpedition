# Spore - Community's Planet Expedition  
A collaboration between various members of the Spore community, to add many new and unique planets to start a new Spore save on.  
**This mod is a WIP! Hopefully it'll eventually have way more unique planets and the weird issues related to Spore's .lvl files will be fixed.**  

# Installation  
Right now, there's no build available of the mod for various reasons. But if you want to try it anyway... 
1. Use [the Spore ModAPI Develpoment Kit](https://emd4600.github.io/Spore-ModAPI/_installation.html) to compile both the mod and [a newer version of the Spore ModAPI Core DLLs](https://emd4600.github.io/Spore-ModAPI/_dev_d_l_ls.html).
2. Use [Sporemodder FX](https://emd4600.github.io/SporeModder-FX/) to turn the mod's project file into a Spore `.package` file.  

when the mod is finished, it'll be made available in this repo's Releases page as a `.sporemod` file, to install through the Spore ModAPI Easy Installer.
